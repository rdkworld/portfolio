Getting Started with Ansible
In this hands-on lab, we'll install Ansible on a control node and configure two managed servers for use with Ansible. We will also create a simple inventory and run an Ansible command to verify our configuration is correct.

This course is not approved or sponsored by Red Hat.

Install Ansible on the Control Node
Log in to the control node using ssh, cloud_user, and the provided public IP address and password:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC IP>
To install Ansible on the control node:

sudo yum install ansible
Configure the ansible User on the Control Node
Next, we'll configure the ansible user on the control node for ssh shared key access to managed nodes.

Note: Do not use a passphrase for the key pair.

Create a key pair for the ansible user on the control host, accepting the defaults when prompted:

sudo su - ansible
ssh-keygen
Copy the public key to both node1 and node2:

ssh-copy-id node1
ssh-copy-id node2
Create a Simple Ansible Inventory
Next, we'll create a simple Ansible inventory on the control node in /home/ansible/inventory containing node1 and node2.

On the control host:

sudo su - ansible
touch /home/ansible/inventory
echo "node1" >> /home/ansible/inventory
echo "node2" >> /home/ansible/inventory
Configure sudo Access for Ansible
Now, we'll configure sudo access for Ansible on node1 and node2 such that Ansible may use sudo for any command with no password prompt.

Log in to node1 as cloud_user and edit the sudoers file to contain appropriate access for the ansible user:

ssh cloud_user@node1
sudo visudo
Add the following line to the file and save:

ansible    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
Enter:

logout
Repeat these steps for node2, and then back out to the control node.

Verify Each Managed Node Is Accessible
Finally, we'll verify each managed node is able to be accessed by Ansible from the control node using the ping module.

Redirect the output of a successful command to /home/ansible/output.

To verify each node, run the following as the ansible user from the control host:

ansible -i /home/ansible/inventory node1 -m ping
ansible -i /home/ansible/inventory node2 -m ping
To redirect output of a successful command to /home/ansible/output:

ansible -i /home/ansible/inventory node1 -m ping > /home/ansible/output
Conclusion
Congratulations on completing this lab!
