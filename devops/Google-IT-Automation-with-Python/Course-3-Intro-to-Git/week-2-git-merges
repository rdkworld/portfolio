# Git Merges

In this lab, you'll use your knowledge of Git and Git commit history to check out an existing repo and make some changes to it. You'll also test what you learned about rolling back commits after bad changes in order to fix a script in the repo and run it to produce the correct output.
What you'll do

    Check the status and history of an existing Git repo
    Create a branch
    Modify content on the branch
    Make rollback changes
    Merge the branch
    
## Commands

* cd ~/food-scripts #navigate to food scripts folder
* cat favorite_foods.log

### Understanding the repository

* git log
* git branch

* git branch <branch-name> #create a new branch named branch-name
* git checkout <branch-name> #move from master branch to branch-name branch

* git add <file-name> #move changes to staging area in the branch
* git commit -m "commit message"

* git revert <commit-id> #revert to this commit
