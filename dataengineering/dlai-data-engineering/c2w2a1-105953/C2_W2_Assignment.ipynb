    "### 2.4 - Optional - API Rate Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: This is an optional section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect to take into account when working with APIs is regarding the rate limits. Rate limiting is a mechanism used by APIs to control the number of requests that a client can make within a specified period of time. It helps prevent abuse or overload of the API by limiting the frequency or volume of requests from a single client. Here's how rate limiting typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Request Quotas: APIs may enforce a maximum number of requests that a client can make within a given time window, for example, 100 requests per minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Windows: The time window specifies the duration over which the request quota is measured. For example, a rate limit of 100 requests per minute means that the client can make up to 100 requests in any 60-second period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Response to Exceeding Limits: When a client exceeds the rate limit, the API typically responds with an error code (such as 429 Too Many Requests) or a message indicating that the rate limit has been exceeded. This allows clients to adjust their behavior accordingly, such as by implementing [exponential backoff](https://medium.com/bobble-engineering/how-does-exponential-backoff-work-90ef02401c65) and other retry strategies. (Check [here](https://harish-bhattbhatt.medium.com/best-practices-for-retry-pattern-f29d47cd5117) or [here](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rate Limit Headers: APIs may include headers in the response to indicate the client's current rate limit status, such as the number of requests remaining until the limit resets or the time at which the limit will reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting helps maintain the stability and reliability of APIs by ensuring fair access to resources and protecting against abusive or malicious behavior. It also allows API providers to allocate resources more effectively and manage traffic loads more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see more of the specifics of the rate limits of the Spotify Web API in the [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/rate-limits). Particularly, this API doesn't enforce a hard limit for the number of requests done but it works dynamically based on the number of calls within a rolling 30 seconds window. You can find some [blogs](https://medium.com/mendix/limiting-your-amount-of-calls-in-mendix-most-of-the-time-rest-835dde55b10e#:~:text=The%20Spotify%20API%20service%20has,for%2060%20requests%20per%20minute) where experiments have been done to identify the average number of requests per minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you are provided with a code that benchmarks the API calls; you can play with the number of requests and the request interval to see the average time of a request. In case you perform too many requests so that you violate the rate limits, you will get a 429 status code.\n",
