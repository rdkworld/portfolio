Effective visual communication can enhance understanding of the insights you gained while processing data, uncover trends, and drive strategic actions in any data-centric organization. In this lab, you will use a star schema model created on top of the `classicmodels` dataset, you will create analytical views on top of this model and then display the results in a dashboard using Apache Superset."
