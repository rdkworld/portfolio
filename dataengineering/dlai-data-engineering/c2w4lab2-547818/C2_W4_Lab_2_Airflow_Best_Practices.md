# Week 4 Lab 2:<br> Airflow 101 - Best Practices

In this lab, you will apply some of the best practices in orchestrating data 
pipelines in Airflow. You will build two DAGs that extract data from an RDS 
database, transform it and load it into a storage service. After this lab, 
you'll be able to:

- Implement variables and templating in an Airflow DAG following best practices
- Integrate cross-communication between Airflow Tasks using XCOMs
- Organize Airflow Tasks into groups to improve DAG readability and monitoring

If you get stuck with completing the code in the exercises, you can download the 
solution files by running the following command in your Cloud9 environment:

```bash
aws s3 cp --recursive s3://dlai-data-engineering/labs/c2w4lab2-547818-solution/ ./
```

In case your Apache Airflow environment presents any issues, you can always 
restart it by running the following bash script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/restart_airflow.sh
```

This process will end when the service is healthy. That should take less than 3 minutes.


## 1 - Best Practices in Writing DAGs

In this first section, we will review some of the best practices in writing DAGs 
in Airflow, which you've already seen in the video tutorials or the reading
items of this lesson. In the remaining sections, you will apply those practices 
in Airflow. Feel free to directly start with the second section, if those 
practices are still fresh in your mind.

### 1.1 - Determinism and Idempotence

Airflow best practices help you write reproducible, efficient and reliable code, 
appropriately share data between tasks and reduce the time to recover from a 
data downtime. Determinism and Idempotence, which are essential concepts in Data 
Engineering, are the basis for reproducible and reliable data pipelines. 
**Determinism** means that the same input will always produce the same output. 
**Idempotence** means if you execute the same operation multiple times, you will 
obtain the same result.

In Airflow, you can achieve determinism and idempotence by correctly defining 
your DAGs and tasks, using built-in Airflow variables, and building 
parameterized operators. When defining your DAG, there are several parameters 
that you can specify to manage your DAG execution and ensure that it is 
deterministic and idempotent. The following are the most important ones:

- The `schedule` parameter: defines the frequency at which the DAG will be 
executed.
- The `start_date` parameter: defines the start date of the first data interval. 
The start date should be static to avoid missing DAG runs and prevent confusion; 
static date means a fixed date like `datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 20)`. 
- The `catchup` parameter: defines whether the DAG will be executed for all the 
data intervals between the `start_date` and the current date. It is recommended 
that you set it to `False` to have more control over the execution of the DAG. 
You can also use the 
[Backfill]
(https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/dag-run.html#backfill) 
feature to execute the DAG for a specific date range.

### 1.2 - Built-in Variables and Templating

Templating allows Airflow tasks to dynamically evaluate information at runtime 
and use it to execute tasks. You can use templating to dynamically evaluate 
either user-created variables or built-in Airflow variables. The templating 
syntax is `{{ variable }}`. You can find more information about templating in 
the [Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/variables.html#templating-with-variables).

An advantage of Airflow templating is that it leverages the power of 
[Jinja Templating](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/operators.html#concepts-jinja-templating), as it uses double curly braces `{{}}` to 
retrieve the information, avoiding the need to write top-level code in your 
DAG file.

Airflow provides a set of [built-in variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.12/macros-ref.html) that you can use to retrieve information about the execution of your DAG. For 
example, you can use the `{{ ds }}` variable to retrieve the DAG runâ€™s logical 
date as `YYYY-MM-DD`. In this way, your specific DAG run will be able to 
retrieve the information detailed to its execution and achieve determinism.

You can also use Macros to transform or format the built-in variables, for 
example, you could change the format of the `{{ ds }}` variable using the 
`macros.ds_format` function. You can find more documentation [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/templates-ref.html#airflow.macros.ds_format).

### 1.3 - User-Created Variables

Hard-coded and duplicated values can harm your DAG. Updating those values in 
multiple places can be tedious and open the door for errors. To avoid this 
unnecessary burden and follow the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle, a best
practice is to use [user-created variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/variable.html),
allowing you to store, update, retrieve and delete key-value content to be used 
dynamically by your DAG.

To access a user-created variable inside the DAG, you can use this example:

```python 
from airflow.models import Variable
foo = Variable.get("foo")
```

### 1.4 - XCOMs

Airflow tasks are executed independently but sometimes you need to share 
information between the tasks. For example, you might need to pass information 
from one task to another task, or you might have to gather information from a 
previous task. In these cases, you can use XCOMs to share information between 
tasks.

An XCOM is identified by a key, as well as the `task_id` and `dag_id` where it 
came from. They are stored using the `xcom_push` method and retrieved using the 
`xcom_pull` method inside the task. But, many operators will automatically
push their results into an XCOM key called `return_value`.

Because XCOMs are stored in the Airflow metadata database by default, you should 
not use them to store large amounts of data as they can harm the performance of 
your Airflow database. Instead, you can use them to store small pieces of
information that you need to share between tasks.

```python 
# Pushing an XCom
context['ti'].xcom_push(key='data_key', value=data)

# Pulling an XCom
data = context['ti'].xcom_pull(key='data_key', task_ids='task_id')
```

### 1.5 - Task Groups

In Airflow, you can group tasks using Task Groups. Task Groups allow you to 
group tasks in the Airflow UI, organize your DAGs and make them more readable. 
Inside the task group, you can define tasks and the dependencies between them 
using the bit-shift operators `<<` and `>>`. You can create a Task Group using 
the `with` statement, as shown in the following example.

```python 
from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup

with DAG(...):
    start = DummyOperator(...)

    task_group = []
    with TaskGroup(...) as etl_tg:
        task_a = PythonOperator(...)

        task_b = PythonOperator(...)
        
        task_a >> task_b

        # append each of the `etl_tg` elements into the `task_group`
        task_group.append(etl_tg)

    end = DummyOperator(...)

    start >> task_group >> end 
```

> **Note:** This lab uses `pandas` to transform the data within the Airflow 
instance. This is done for educational purposes. It is not desirable in 
real-life Airflow pipelines for the following two reasons:
>
> - Airflow should interact with storage and processing solutions using 
operators specifically designed for them.
> - Airflow should only be an orchestrator, and it should delegate the actual 
processing the workload of the pipeline to the appropriate tools such as databases 
or Spark clusters.
>
> This is a BAD practice, but one that would help here to show you the best 
practices in other aspects of Airflow.

## 2 - Exploring Airflow's Components and Lab Resources

For this lab, you are provided with a MySQL database that represents the 
source system you will interact with. The database `classicmodels` ([MySQL Sample Database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx)) is already instantiated for you in Amazon RDS. 
You have used this database in the previous labs. In this lab, you will interact 
with  4 of its tables: `orders`, `customers` , `payments` and `products` to 
create two DAGs.  If you need to review how to access the database, you can read 
the instructions in the last (optional) section of this lab.  

You are provided with a dockerized version of Airflow that is running on an EC2 
instance. You will only need to interact with the Airflow UI and the S3 bucket 
that represents the DAG directory, not with the EC2 instance directly.

2.1. To access your Airflow UI, go to the AWS console and search for 
**CloudFormation**. You will see two stacks deployed, one associated with your 
Cloud9 environment (name with prefix `aws-cloud9`) and another named with an 
alphanumeric ID. Click on the alphanumeric ID stack and search for the 
**Outputs** tab. You will see the key `AirflowDNS` with the complete URL to 
access the Airflow UI in the **Value** column. Copy it and paste it into another 
browser tab. You will see a login page, use the following credentials:

* username: `airflow`
* password: `airflow`

> **Note:** It might happen that you won't see a login screen straight away. As 
the Airflow's components deployment can take several minutes, it is possible 
that the first time you copy the URL, the service will not be yet available. You 
can continue working on the following exercises in Cloud9 and refresh the 
Airflow UI tab in a few minutes to see the login screen.

2.2. Review the [CloudFormation Outputs](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks?) of the deployed stack. There are other values that 
you will need for the lab.

Similarly to the previous lab, you'll use _Raw Data Bucket_ to write code, 
create and delete files, and _DAGs Bucket_ to upload the Python scripts 
defining your DAGs (which will be recognized by Airflow). Check the names of 
those two buckets in the CloudFormation Outputs.

## 3 - Building a Simple DAG

You will use the following DAG which comprises five tasks to process the `orders`
 table from `classicmodels`.

### 3.1 - DAG Structure

![Simple DAG](images/simple_dag.png "Simple DAG")

Here are the descriptions of the DAG tasks:

-  `start`: is an empty task marking the start of the DAG. Here you will use `DummyOperator`. 
Similarly to `EmptyOperator` it doesn't include any behavior, but it creates a task instance 
in the Airflow metadata database.

- `extract_load_orders`: extracts data from the table `orders` and loads it into 
a zone in the S3 bucket (bronze zone), using the following destination path:
    ```
    s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/bronze/orders/YYYY/MM/DD/
    ```
    You will implement this task using the
    [SqlToS3Operator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/stable/transfer/sql_to_s3.html).
    It is an Amazon transfer operator, which you can use to copy data from a SQL
     server to an S3 file. 

- `transform_orders`: transforms the data extracted from the table `orders` and
 loads it into another zone of the S3 bucket (silver zone), using the following destination path: 
    ```
    s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/silver/orders/YYYY/MM/DD/
    ```
    The transformation consists of dropping the null records and duplicate rows
     from the table `orders`. You will execute this task using the 
     `PythonOperator` that calls the `drop_nas_and_duplicates` function.

- `notification`: emulates a notification task that sends an email with the 
number of the resultant records in the transformed table. In this lab, this task 
will just print the number of rows of the transformed data. You will execute 
this task using the `PythonOperator` that calls the `notify_valid_records` 
function.

- `end`: is an empty task marking the end of the DAG. It doesn't include any 
behavior and will be executed also with the `DummyOperator`.

Note that in this lab, the functions `drop_nas_and_duplicates` and 
`notify_valid_records` are defined outside the DAG definition, at the start of 
the Python script.

### 3.2 - Preparing the Python Code

In this section, you will need to complete the Python script `simple_dag.py`, 
which you can find in the folder `src/` Once you're done, you'll upload the 
file to the appropriate bucket and manually trigger the DAG in the Airflow UI.

### Exercise 1

Complete the definitions of the DAG in `src/simple_dag.py`, in the section 
associated with `EXERCISE 1`. The DAG should have the following characteristics:

- run daily;
- a static start date using the `datetime` object. You can specify the date at 
which you're doing the lab;
- not run for past dates.

Note: To start exercise 1, you need to scroll down to get to the `with` 
statement where the DAG is instantiated. 

### Exercise 2

In this exercise, you will use the `ds` variable to retrieve the DAG runâ€™s 
logical date (see Section 1.2 above). You will use this information to define 
the destination path in S3, for the data you will extract and load from the 
`orders` table. This way, when the same DAG runs for different data intervals, 
the extracted data will be organized in S3 according to the date it belongs to. 
We will refer to this date as the S3 partition date.

Define the `partition_date` variable in `src/simple_dag.py` file, in the section 
associated with `EXERCISE 2`. The partition_date should be in the `YYYY/MM/DD` 
format.

### Exercise 3

Airflow has the concept of [Connection](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/connections.html) that you can use to store credentials that enable your DAG to 
connect to external systems. A connection consists of a set of parameters - such
 as login, password and hostname - along with the connection type and connection
  Id. You can create a connection in the Airflow UI and then use the connection 
  ID in your code. In this exercise, you will create a connection that contains 
  the values of the parameters needed to connect to the MYSQL database and then pass
   the connection ID to `SqlToS3Operator`.

1. Create a connection in the Airflow UI: select the **Admin** tab in the 
header, then select the **Connections** option. 
    Click the add button **+** and complete the connection with the following 
    values:
    - `Connection Id`: A unique identifier for the connection, e.g. 
    `mysql_connection`.
    - `Connection type`: Select `MySQL` from the dropdown menu (you may need to scroll
    down through the list).
    - `Host`: Endpoint of the RDS database. One of the **CloudFormation** 
    stack outputs.
    - `Schema`: The schema name of the RDS database. In this case, it is 
    `classicmodels`. (See optional section below: when you connect to MySQL RDS,
     you can run the command `show databases` to get the schema or database 
     name).
    - `Login`: The user for the RDS database. You can find it in the 
    **CloudFormation** stack tab **Parameters**, value for the key 
    `DatabaseUserName`.
    - `Password`: The password for the user in the RDS database. In this case, 
    it is`adminpwrd`.
    - `Port`:  The port for the RDS database. In your case, `3306` is the 
    default port for MySQL.

    This is an example of how the Connection creation should look like:
    ![Connection example](images/connection.png "Connection example").

    Click on **Save**.

2. Create a variable in the Airflow UI: select the **Admin** tab in the header, 
then select the **Variables** option. 
    Click the add button **+** and complete the variable with the following 
    values:
    - `Key`: `s3_bucket`,
    - `Val`: name of the _Raw Data Bucket_.

     Click on **Save**.

3. Complete the definition of the `extract_load_orders` task, which uses 
`SqlToS3Operator`. Follow the instructions in the section. When you get to the 
SQL query part, you need to write a SQL statement to retrieve all the data 
from the `orders` table:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM orders;
    ```

### Exercise 4

Complete the function `drop_nas_and_duplicates` in the `src/simple_dag.py` file,
 in the section associated with `EXERCISE 4` (at the start of the script). This 
 function includes the transformation steps, where you can use `pandas` to do 
 basic data cleaning - detecting null rows and dropping duplicate rows.

### Exercise 5

Complete the `transform_orders` task in the `src/simple_dag.py` file, in the 
section associated with `EXERCISE 5` using the `drop_nas_and_duplicates` 
function you defined in the previous exercise.

The `transform_orders` task is in charge of dropping nulls and duplicate rows 
from the `orders` table, which you loaded into the S3 bucket in Exercise 3. 
After that, the same task will store the transformed data back to S3. This task 
will also push the number of rows left after the transformation into an XCOM.

### Exercise 6

Complete the function `notify_valid_records` in the `src/simple_dag.py` file, in
the section associated with `EXERCISE 6` (at the start of the script). Use XCOM 
pull to extract the value pushed from the `transform_orders` task.

### Exercise 7

Complete the `notification` task in the `src/simple_dag.py` file, in the section
 associated with `EXERCISE 7`. Use the function `notify_valid_records`you 
 defined in exercise 6.

### Exercise 8

Finish the DAG by completing the task dependencies at the end of the file, use 
the bit-shift operators `>>` to define the relation between the tasks. When you 
load your DAG in the Airflow UI, the DAG should look like the DAG visualized in 
section 3.

## 4 - Running Your DAGs with Airflow

After you've finished all the exercises, the `simple_dag.py` file should be 
ready to be uploaded to the DAG directory. To upload your file to the
 _DAGs Bucket_, remember first to save any changes or updates to 
 `simple_dag.py` and then use the following command from the Cloud9 terminal:

```bash
aws s3 sync src s3://<DAGS-BUCKET>/dags
```

Once the environment has finished syncing the content of the buckets (remember 
it can take up to 10 minutes), go to the Airflow UI. Keep refreshing the web 
interface, and after a couple of minutes, you should see that it recognizes 
your simple DAG. You will also get an error with loading the second DAG. Don't 
worry about it, as you're going to complete the second DAG in the next section.

Now activate (unpause) the simple DAG and trigger the DAG manually with the run 
button on the right. If the tasks didn't succeed, use the logs to find the 
problem and return to the corresponding script to correct it.

If your runs didn't succeed the first time, and you have already detected and 
corrected the source of the problem, go back to Airflow's web interface and 
navigate to the Grid view page. There you can rerun the failed tasks so
that Airflow performs them again. When you get successful runs, go to the
 _Raw Data Bucket_ (not the _DAGs Bucket_) to see if the appropriate files were 
 created.

## 5 - Grouped Tasks DAG

### 5.1 - DAG Structure

Here is the second DAG you will set up:

![Grouped Task DAG](images/grouped_tasks_dag.png "Grouped Task DAG")

- `start`: is an empty task marking the start of the DAG. It doesn't include any
 behavior.

- `extract_load_<table>`: extracts data from the table `<table>` and loads it 
into the S3 bucket (_Raw Data Bucket_). The destination path is 
`s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/bronze/<table>/YYYY/MM/DD/`.
You will execute this task using the 
[SqlToS3Operator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/stable/transfer/sql_to_s3.html).

- `transform_<table>`: transforms the data extracted from the table `<table>`
and loads it into another zone of the S3 bucket. The destination path is
 `s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/silver/<table>/YYYY/MM/DD/`. The transformation also 
 consists
of dropping the null records and duplicate rows. You will also use a 
`PythonOperator` which will call the `drop_nas_and_duplicates` function.

The remaining tasks `send_notification`and `end` are similar to the tasks you 
implemented in the first DAG. Note that the task `send_notification` will print 
the number of the resultant records of each table.

For this set of exercises, you have to complete the `TaskGroups` required to 
extract, load, and transform the `payments`, `customers` and `products` tables 
from the `classicmodels` dataset in the `src/grouped_task_dag.py`.

### 5.2 - Preparing the Python Code

### Exercise 9

Go through the code in the file `src/grouped_task_dag.py` to check the 
components of the tasks. Find the section related to `Exercise 9` and complete 
the code, defining the dependency between the task `extract_load` and 
`transform`. Then append the tasks into the `task_group` variable.

### Exercise 10

Finish the DAG by completing the task dependencies at the end of the file, use 
the bit-shift operators `>>`. It should look like the DAG visualized in the section 
5.1. Follow the instructions in `4 - Running Your DAGs with Airflow` section to 
test the DAG script.

In this lab, you have implemented an idempotent and deterministic DAG, applying 
several best practices. You have used templating and variables to dynamically 
retrieve information and avoid hard-coded and duplicated values. You have also
used XCOMs to share data between tasks and Task Groups to organize your DAGs and
 make them more readable.

## 6 - Optional material

Here is some information about the `classicmodels` database. It contains typical
 business data about classic car retailers, including information about 
 customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, and more; however, 
 you will only be working with the following tables:

- `orders`: Contains information about orders placed by customers, including the
 status and significant dates of the process.
- `customers`: Contains basic information about customers, such as their name, 
phone, and location.
- `products`: Contains information about products, including the name, product 
line, and price.

Here are the steps to connect to the database and explore the data:

6.1. Get the endpoint of the database instance in the 
**CloudFormation Outputs**. 

6.2. Now connect to the database by running the following command, replacing 
`<MySQLEndpoint>` with the output from the previous step:

``` bash
mysql --host=<MySQLEndpoint> --user=admin --password=adminpwrd --port=3306
```

You will access MySQL monitor which gives visibility into the performance and 
availability of the instance.

6.3. Now that you checked the existence of the Amazon RDS MySQL instance, you 
can verify that the data exists within the database:

``` bash
use classicmodels;
show tables;
```

You should get an output similar to this one:

![show_tables](./images/show_tables.png)

6.4. Enter `exit` in the terminal to quit the database connection.

``` bash
exit
```
