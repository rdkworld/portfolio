Apache Flink is designed to handle data in real time, allowing you to process and analyze streaming data as soon as it arrives. This enables timely insights and immediate reactions to changing data.\n",

        "Here you will work with a Kinesis data producer similar to the one introduced in Course 1, Week 4. This producer is continuously generating data related to orders made by customers on the [`classicmodels`](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx) website. The business team at Classic Models is eager to gain deeper, real-time insights into the behavior of clients on their websites. By analyzing this streaming data, they aim to understand user buying habits, preferences, and other business metrics as they happen. Through this lab, you will leverage Apache Flink to process and analyze this data stream, providing the business team with valuable, actionable insights in real time.\n",

These data streams can be either unbounded, such as continuous streams of real-time data or bounded, like a finite batch of data. Flink is structured around two major APIs: the **DataStream API** and the **Table API & SQL**. The DataStream API is tailored for complex event processing and real-time analytics, while the Table API & SQL offers a more declarative approach to data processing, akin to traditional database operations.\n",

PyFlink enables developers to harness the power of Flink using Python, making it accessible to those familiar with the language. Additionally, PyFlink integrates with `pandas`, allowing for seamless data manipulation and analysis within the Flink ecosystem. You use the PyFlink Table API to run queries on top of a Kinesis data stream, but first, you will learn how to use PyFlink with some sample data we provided.
