    "# Week 2 Lab: Streaming Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will interact with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and gain a better understanding of how the streaming ingestion process is performed. The lab consists of two parts:\n",
    "1. In the first part, you will work with a Kinesis Data Stream acting as a router between a simple producer and a simple consumer. Using the producer application, you will manually generate data and write it to the Kinesis Data Stream. After that, you will consume the generated data from that stream.\n",
    "2. In the second part, you will perform a streaming ETL process: you will consume data from a Kinesis Data Stream that is fed by a producer. You will apply some simple transformations to this data, and then put the transformed data into one of two other data streams. From each of these two new data streams, data will be taken by a Kinesis Firehose and delivered to their respective S3 buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck on any of the lab steps, you can check the solution notebook *C2_W2_Lab_1_Streaming_Ingestion_Solution.ipynb* and script *src/etl/consumer_Solution.py* that you can download by running the following command in your Cloud9 environment: \n",

    "\n",
    "In the lab of Week 4 of Course 1, you interacted with a Kinesis Data Stream that streams online user activities as events or records. You then processed these records to compute the product recommendations and used a Data Firehose instance to deliver the records to an S3 bucket in your pipeline. In that lab, we did not show you how you can stream the recommendations back to the web. So in the second part of this lab, you will again interact with the same Kinesis Data Stream as your source system, ingest from it the online user activity, perform some computations on this data and finally create your own Kinesis Data Streams to continue streaming the transformed data inside your data pipeline. In this lab, to keep the transformation step simple, you will not compute the product recommendations from the ingested data, you will instead apply some simple transformations to the ingested data. But before you perform those steps (second part of the lab), you will first go through the first part of the lab to gain a better understanding of the components of a streaming platform.  "
