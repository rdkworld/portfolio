        "As a Data Engineer, you may not frequently need to perform data normalization from scratch, but understanding the steps involved in this process is crucial. Typically, you will encounter source databases that are already normalized, and your task will often involve denormalizing this data to make it useful for extracting insights or solving business questions. This lab focuses on the opposite process: taking a dataset that has been loaded as a One Big Table and normalizing it up to the third normal form, which is common in transactional systems."

        "\n",
        "Normalization is a database design technique that organizes tables to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, less redundant tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications can be made in a single table and then propagated through the rest of the database using defined relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the benefits of having a normalized set of tables are the following: \n",
        "- Reduce Data Redundancy: Eliminating duplicate data, which helps in saving storage space and ensures consistency across the database.\n",
        "- Improve Data Integrity: Ensuring that each piece of data is stored in only one place, reducing the likelihood of data anomalies and maintaining the accuracy of the data.\n",
        "- Enhance Query Performance: By organizing data into related tables, you have made it easier to query and manage the data, leading to better performance and easier maintenance."
