An [Expectation](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/reference/learn/terms/expectation/) is a statement about your data that can be validated, serving to improve data quality and facilitating clearer communication about data features. Similar to assertions in Python unit tests, Expectations offer a descriptive language for specifying the conditions the data should meet. However, unlike conventional unit tests, GX applies these Expectations directly to your data rather than to code. There are several types of expectations, such as\n",

    "\n",
    "Now in a production environment, you can't manually validate your data the way you did in the previous exercise. What you can instead do, is to load into your new environment the expectation suite that you stored, and then pass it with your batch requests to a [Checkpoint](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/reference/learn/terms/checkpoint/) object. The checkpoint will automatically create a validator to validate your data against your expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Optional Notes*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why you need to compute the validations independently of the creation of the expectations; some of the advantages of that approach are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity and Reusability: Separating the creation and computation of expectations allows you to modularize your workflow. You can create a set of reusable expectation definitions that can be applied across different batches of your dataset rewriting them each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Workflow Flexibility: Separating expectation creation and computation provides flexibility in how you orchestrate your data quality pipeline. You can trigger expectation computation based on different events or schedules, integrate it with other data processing steps, or parallelize computations across multiple environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource Optimization: Running and computing expectations may require different computational resources or environments compared to expectation creation. Separating these processes allows you to optimize resource allocation and scale each part of the workflow independently based on its specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error Isolation and Debugging: If errors occur during expectation computation, separating the creation process makes it easier to isolate and debug issues. You can focus on troubleshooting the computation step without affecting the expectation definitions themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "*End of optional Notes*\n",
    "\n",
    "A checkpoint object expects a collection of data batches and their corresponding expectation suite. We will call this collection a validations list. So before you create the checkpoint object, let's first create the validations list.\n",
