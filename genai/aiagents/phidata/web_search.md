┃ OpenAI's AI model, Sora, is a powerful text-generating model developed by OpenAI. Sora is based on the GPT-3            ┃
┃ architecture, which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3. GPT-3 is known for its ability to generate         ┃
┃ human-like text and has been widely used in various applications such as chatbots, content generation, creative         ┃
┃ writing, and more.                                                                                                      ┃
┃                                                                                                                         ┃
┃ Sora, being an instance of GPT-3, is trained on a massive amount of text data to learn the patterns of human language   ┃
┃ and is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input provided to it. This model has  ┃
┃ been praised for its ability to understand and generate text in a wide range of topics and styles.                      ┃
┃                                                                                                                         ┃
┃ It's worth mentioning that OpenAI continues to work on improving its AI models, including Sora, to enhance their        ┃
┃ capabilities and ensure responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence technology.                              ┃
┃                                                                                                                         ┃
