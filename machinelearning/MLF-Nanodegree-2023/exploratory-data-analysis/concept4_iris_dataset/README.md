# Exercise: Iris Dataset
Now that you have a good understanding of exploratory data analysis and its importance, it's time to put your knowledge to a more practical example. We'll be focusing on an iris public dataset from the scikit-learn library.

Our main objectives for this dataset are:
1. Load the iris dataset into a pandas dataframe
2. Create a table summary of the features and target values
3. Create a histogram of all the features and target
4. Create a correlation matrix of the features and target
5. Create scatter plots of all the features and target
