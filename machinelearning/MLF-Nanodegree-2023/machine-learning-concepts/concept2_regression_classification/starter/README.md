# Exercise: Regression and Classification Machine Learning

In this exercise, we'll dive deeper into the ML concepts by creating a regression and classification model.

Your tasks for this exercise are:
1. Load the iris dataset into a dataframe
2. Create a LinearRegression model and fit it to the dataset
3. Score the regression model on the dataset and predict it's values
4. Create a RidgeClassifier model and fit it to the dataset, use `alpha=3.0` when initializing the model
5. Score the classification model on the dataset and predict it's values
