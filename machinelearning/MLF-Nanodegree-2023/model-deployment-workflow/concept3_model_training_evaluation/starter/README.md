# Exercise: Model Training and Evaluation

Now that we have the data fundamentals for creating, cleaning, and modifying our datasets, we can train and evaluate a model, in this case it's a linear regression model.

Your tasks for this exercise are:
1. Create a dataframe with the regression dataset, include the features and target within the same dataframe.
2. Create a 60% Train / 20% Validation / 20% Test dataset group using the `train_test_split` method.
3. Fit the LinearRegression model on the training set.
4. Evaluate the model on the validation set.
5. Evaluate the model on the test set.
