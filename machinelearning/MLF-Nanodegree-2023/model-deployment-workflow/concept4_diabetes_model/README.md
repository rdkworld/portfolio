# Exercise: Diabetes Model

In this exercise, we're going to take the knowledge we gained from the lesson and apply it to the [Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset). This well known dataset already has it's data cleaned and normalized, so no need to do any of those steps. The steps required to complete this exercise are as follows:

1. Load the diabetes dataset into a dataframe.
2. Check the table summary to show that indeed the mean is zero for all features.
3. Split the dataset into train, validation, and test sets
4. Use a linear regression `Ridge` model to fit and score:
    1. Fit and score on the whole dataset
    2. Fit on train, score on validation, using default model
    3. Fit on train, score on validation, using hyperparameters model
    4. Fit on train, score on test, using hyperparameterized model
5. Plot all scores in a bar graph
