# Exercise: Linear Models

In this exercise, we'll be exploring two types of linear models, one regression, one classification. While regression is what you typically think of for a linear model, they can also be used effectively in classification problems.

You're tasked with compeleting the following steps:
1. Load in the wine dataset from scikit learn.
2. For the wine dataset, create a train and test split, 80% train / 20% test.
3. Create a LogisticRegression model with these hyper parameters: random_state=0, max_iter=10000
4. Evaluate the model with the test dataset
5. Load the diabetes dataset from scikit learn
6. For the Diabetes dataset, create a train and test split, 80% train / 20% test.
7. Create a SGDRegressor model model with these hyper parameters: random_state=0, max_iter=10000
8. Evaluate the model with the test dataset
